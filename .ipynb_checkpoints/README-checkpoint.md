Predicting cuisine based on ingredients in a recipe

This is a small project based on a kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking. 
The dataset consists of recipes (set of ingredients) labeled with a cuisine. The cuisine prediction is done in Cooking.ipynb and a vector embedding exploration is in Word2Vec.ipynb
